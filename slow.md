Marvellous projects which human beings have undertaken that took an
exceptionally long time. The focus is especially on goal-directed
projects (e.g., a scientific experiment or a building), less on
long-lived institutions or decentralized change (e.g., languages,
domestication of livestock).

What problems can human beings _only_ solve over a very long period of
time? And how can we build institutions that solve those problems?

+ The proof of Fermat's Last Theorem involved an incredible amount of
mathematics developed over many decades, and in some ways
centuries: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiles%27s_proof_of_Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem).

+ Many Cathedrals were built over more than a century. An example
  is [Notre Dame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre-Dame_de_Paris), over 1163-1345. There are, of course, many more.
  
+ An ongoing example is the [Sagrada Familia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagrada_Fam%C3%ADlia), begun in 1882, and
  continuing today.

+ The [Cape Grim Air Archive](https://research.csiro.au/acc/capabilities/cape-grim-air-archive/), which has been archiving air since
  1978, so later researchers can conduct longitudinal studies.
  
+ The [Framingham Heart Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framingham_Heart_Study), a longitudinal study of the heart.

+ The [Central England Temperature series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_England_temperature), from 1659 to the
  present.
  
+ The [E. coli long-term evolution experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._coli_long-term_evolution_experiment), from 1988 to the
  present.
  
+ The [pitch drop experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_drop_experiment) from 1927 to the present.

+ The [Clock of the Long Now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_of_the_Long_Now), which aspires to last 10,000 years.

+ I suspect many key open source systems (Linux, Wikipedia) will still
  be around in 100 years.
