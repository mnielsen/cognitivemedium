A list of marvellous projects which human beings have undertaken that
took an exceptionally long time. Many examples contributed by people
on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/status/1224902391331319809).

The focus is mostly on goal-directed projects (e.g., a scientific
experiment or a building), less on long-lived institutions or
decentralized change (e.g., languages, domestication of livestock,
cities, religions). Of course, those are also fascinating, but they
have less of a sense of a long-term goal. Jericho is incredible, but
the founders probably weren't thinking "I hope this is still here in
9,000 years".

What problems can human beings _only_ solve over a very long period of
time? And how can we build institutions that solve those problems?

This page is
a [riff on Patrick Collison's list of /fast projects](https://patrickcollison.com/fast). There are
surprisingly many commonalities with those projects.

+ The proof of Fermat's Last Theorem involved an incredible amount of
mathematics developed over many decades, and in some ways
centuries: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiles%27s_proof_of_Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem).

+ Many Cathedrals were built over more than a century. An example
  is [Notre Dame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre-Dame_de_Paris), over 1163-1345. There are, of course, many more.
  
+ An ongoing example is the [Sagrada Familia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagrada_Fam%C3%ADlia), begun in 1882, and
  continuing today.

+ The [Cape Grim Air Archive](https://research.csiro.au/acc/capabilities/cape-grim-air-archive/), which has been archiving air since
  1978, so later researchers can conduct longitudinal studies.
  
+ The [Framingham Heart Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framingham_Heart_Study), a longitudinal study of the heart.

+ The [Central England Temperature series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_England_temperature), from 1659 to the
  present.
  
+ The [E. coli long-term evolution experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._coli_long-term_evolution_experiment), from 1988 to the
  present.
  
+ The [pitch drop experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_drop_experiment) from 1927 to the present.

+ The [Clock of the Long Now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_of_the_Long_Now), which aspires to last 10,000 years.

+ I suspect many key open source systems (Linux, Wikipedia) will still
  be around in 100 years. I won't be surprised if certain standards
  still show up in a thousand years, perhaps in a modified form. ASCII
  -> Unicode -> ???  Unix Time? TCP/IP?

+ The [2nd Ave Subway in Manhattan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Avenue_Subway), with preparatory construction
  beginning in 1942. First phase opened in 2017.

+ The [list of oldest companies in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_companies) is food for
  thought. Sad to report the 2006 demise of [Kongo Gumi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kong%C5%8D_Gumi), which
  began in 578. It was in the construction business, originally of
  Shinto Shrines (I believe). Such Shrines undergo a continuous
  process of renewal; an example is the [Izumo-taisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izumo-taisha), which may
  date to BCE.
